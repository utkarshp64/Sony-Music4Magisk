## Introduction

* Welcome to the source of Systemless Sony Music App. This Music application from Sony gives you a wonderful experience when listening to your music files. Import your music, arrange in playlists and just listen away. We(Sony Mobile Communications) optimize the sound to make it sound great and make sure little power is used, so you can listen for as long as you want. This is a magisk module. It will install sony music app to any android device.

### Quick Explanation

* Thing is that Non-sony devices can not install Sony app normally, Unless the app is Modifided means EDITED.. OR you need to copy Sony Muisc app to system partition, Set required permission but this will modifify your system partition which will break your system integrity...
* As this is magisk module you don't need to worry about system space or system integrity. Magisk will install this app to magisk.img which is mounted in your data partition... For your system it is still installed as system app without installing in system. Doesn't make any sence! WELL This is magic of MAGISK....!
